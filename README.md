# Player Spotter (Fabric, Minecraft 1.21.11)

Client-side mod. It makes other players glow, shows their name, and shows a distance
meter with an arrow pointing down at their head. Nothing is sent to the server, so it
needs no server install and works on any multiplayer server.

## Features
- Glow on other players, with your own color (presets or RGB sliders)
- Name above the head (server/tab/team name, or plain account name)
- Distance meter `[|||||     ]` with meters text, **on/off**
- Auto fill: the bar fills as the player gets closer (off = always full)
- Arrow pointing down to the head, **on/off**
- **Unlimited range** (ON by default): glow, name, meter and arrow show at any distance.
  Turn it OFF to use the range slider **1 to 16 chunks** instead.
- Master on/off, everything saved in `config/playerspotter.json`
- Settings screen from **Mod Menu** (Configure button) or the **K** key
- **V** key turns the whole mod on/off

## Build
You need Java 21.

```
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 9.2.1     # only once, if there is no gradlew yet
./gradlew build                           # Windows: gradlew.bat build
```

The mod jar is `build/libs/player-spotter-1.0.0.jar`. Put it in `.minecraft/mods`
with Fabric Loader 0.17.3+ and Fabric API for 1.21.11. Mod Menu is optional
(but needed for the Configure button).

## Notes
- "Unlimited" means the mod adds no limit of its own. The game only knows where a player is
  while the server has loaded them for you, so the real maximum is the server's view distance.
  A player farther than that cannot be drawn by any client mod.
- The arrow position is exact in first person. In third person it follows your head,
  not the camera.
- Many servers (Hypixel, competitive/PvP servers) ban glow/ESP style mods. Use it where it is allowed.

## Build with GitHub (no Java or Gradle needed on your PC)
1. Make a free GitHub account and create a new repository.
2. Upload all files from this project (keep the `.github` folder).
3. Open the **Actions** tab. The "Build mod jar" workflow runs by itself (about 5 minutes).
   You can also press **Run workflow**.
4. Open the finished run, scroll to **Artifacts**, and download `player-spotter-jar`.
   Unzip it to get `player-spotter-1.0.0.jar`.

## Choose which players to show
Open the settings (K or Mod Menu) -> **Choose players...**
- Type a name and press **Add**. Players near you whose name starts with what you typed
  show up as buttons (auto fill). Click one to fill the name.
- Only listed players get glow, name, meter and arrow.
- Click a name in the list (`[x] Name`) to remove it. Up to 12 names.
- Turn **Only listed players** OFF to show everyone again.
